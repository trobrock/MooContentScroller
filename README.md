MooContentScroller
===========

MooContentScroller is a simple plugin that allows the user to scroll through information that is contained in some container that has it's overflow hidden. This can be especially useful in situations when you are given a page design that cannot stretch, this will allow the content to still be easily viewed

How to use
----------

We expect this section for every plugin. It just explains how to use your plugin.
Never should a plugin rely on a 3rd party link to explain its behavior or functionality. We need this to ensure that if a website is removed or becomes inaccessible, people can still enjoy your plugins' functionality.

It often includes code snippets, which are just indented pieces of text:

	var script = new MyScript()
	script.doSomething();

Syntax highlighting will be done automatically for you.

Arbitrary section
-----------------

This is an arbitrary section. You can have as many of these as you want.
Some arbitrary section examples:

* FAQ
* Notes
* Misc
* Known issues

The name is up to you, but remember to keep it meaningful and simple. Arbitrary sections are always optional.
